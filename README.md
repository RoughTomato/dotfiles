# OpenBox dotfiles: Comfy edition
â€‹
Compilation of configurations for my development environment.

My personal changes come with no license, use them as you please.
All the original code/configurations come with their respective licenses, please respect them.

Please, don't change things in your dotfiles before you understand what you're doing. Some of the changes if wrongly set-up might render program unusable.

If you used these files and want to share it with me, feel free to. I'll gladly check things out for myself, especially if they're quality of life improvements.
